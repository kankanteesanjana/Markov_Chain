# Markov_Chain

I gathered real-life biking data through a mobile application, capturing valuable insights into bikers' movements, specifically focusing on speed and slope variations in both uphill and downhill scenarios.
With this extensive dataset, I classified slopes as a reference and utilized speeds to define different states. This classification allowed me to construct transition matrices for each slope, revealing transition probabilities between speed states. The aggregation of these transition probabilities and occurrences of each slope formed a Markovian chain, providing a comprehensive view of behavior throughout the entire dataset. 

This analysis not only sheds light on the original data but also facilitates the generation of simulated data based on the established Markov chain. The results are corroborated through the eigen vector method and long simulations, ensuring the reliability of the obtained insights.
This approach presents a practical application where each slope point corresponds to specific states and speeds, determining probabilities and offering a nuanced understanding of behavior in the form of a Markov chain.
